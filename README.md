Recommendations for the future.
1. Pagination of Album list data.
2. Adding animations on item load.
3. Giving choice to the user what filter he wants to apply on the list.
4. Adding loading indicators in case of delay while loading the list. Something like shimmer effect.
5. Beautifying the UI
6. Adding network checks before making a network call.
7. Creating different builds for release and debug. Disable logs in release build.
